    <p>
      Dr. Norman Borlaug (1914-2009) was an American agronomist and humanitarian
      who is often referred to as the "father of the Green Revolution." His work
      in developing high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat varieties helped
      alleviate hunger and poverty in many parts of the world, particularly in
      Mexico, India, and Pakistan. Borlaug's contributions to agriculture earned
      him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.
